# Introduction

This is a PyTorch implementation of:

Multimodal sentiment analysis with CMU-MOSEI dataset

2 base unimodal subnetworks and 3 fusion networks

unimodal & bimodal & trimodal comparison

# Unimodal Subnetwork

DNN

CNN

# Fusion Networks

Simple Fusion Networks

Tensor Fusion Networks

Low-Rank Tensor Fusion Networks

# Notice

It requires PyTorch and the CMU Multimodal Data SDK (https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalDataSDK) 
to function properly.
